# Audrey's Mail Generator

## Description

Audrey's Mail Generator is a simple yet handy tool designed to help anyone guess or generate potential email addresses based on a person's first name, last name, and company name.

Originally built to help my campus manager at Holberton School, who frequently contacts professionals for talks, networking, or partnership opportunities, this tool automates a task she used to do manually: trying different email combinations in the hopes of finding the right one.

Beyond this specific use case, it can also serve as inspiration for those looking to create a professional email address for their own future company.

It‚Äôs a small tool with a big impact, and a nice opportunity to reinforce my JavaScript skills and DOM manipulation in a real-world context.

## Objectives

- Generate a variety of plausible email addresses from basic inputs.
- Save time and increase outreach efficiency by reducing guesswork.
- Use this as a practical exercise to improve JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.
- Provide a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS.
- Explore text parsing, string combination logic, and clipboard APIs.
